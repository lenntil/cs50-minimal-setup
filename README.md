# CS50 Minimal Setup for macOS and Linux

## Prerequisites
This guide assumes that:
- You can use command line.\
  [Command line crash course - Learn web development | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line)
- Git is installed.\
  [Git - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Getting started

Before starting, make sure that you are in the project directory containing [test.c](./test.c) (or some C code to compile).

First, clone the `libcs50` git repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cs50/libcs50.git
```

Then, your project directory will be like (ommitted unnecessary ones):

```console
$ tree
.
├── README.md
├── build.sh
├── libcs50
│   ├── LICENSE
│   ├── Makefile
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── cs50.c
│   │   └── cs50.h
│   └── tests
└── test.c
```

`cd` into the cloned directory (`libcs50`) and build:

```sh
cd libcs50
make
```

Then, your build directory will be like:

```console
$ cd build
$ tree
.
├── include
│   └── cs50.h
├── lib
│   ├── libcs50-11.0.2.dylib
│   ├── libcs50.a
│   └── libcs50.dylib -> libcs50-11.0.2.dylib
└── src
    └── cs50.c
```

To build a C program, you need `cs50.h` and either `libcs50-11.0.2.dylib` (for Dynamic Linking) or `libcs50.a` (for Static Linking).

## Option 1. Dynamic linking

Place `libcs50-11.0.2.dylib` in your CS50 project directory. The contents of the project directory will look like:

```console
$ ls
cs50.h        test.c        libcs50-11.0.2.dylib
```

Build `test.c` as follows:

```sh
cc -o test test.c -lcs50
```

## Option 2-1. Static linking

Place `libcs50.a` in your CS50 project directory. The contents of the project directory will be:

```console
$ ls
cs50.h        test.c        libcs50.a
```

Build `test.c` as follows:

```sh
cc -o test test.c libcs50.a
```

## Option 2-2. Static linking - Using flags to link libraries

Use the following flags in your compile command:

- `-I` for include path.

Build `test.c` as follows:

```sh
cc -o test test.c -I./libcs50/build/include ./libcs50/build/lib/libcs50.a
```

For an enhanced version, see [Build Script](./build.sh).

## Running the program

After building, you can run the `test` binary file with:

```sh
./test
```

## Why?

1. A minimal setup will lower the barrier to C programming.
2. You don't want to mess up the system's `lib` directory with a library that will never be reused.
3. In macOS, there are some problems with `dyld` (Dynamic Link Editor). For example, if you have disabled SIP (System Integrity Protection), you might encounter issues when following the methods described in official guides.
