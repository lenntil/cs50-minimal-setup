# CS50 Minimal Setup for macOS and Linux

## Prerequisites

- [Git - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Getting Started

First, clone the git repository and build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cs50/libcs50.git
cd libcs50
make
```

Your build directory will then look like this:

```console
$ cd build
$ tree
.
├── include
│   └── cs50.h
├── lib
│   ├── libcs50-11.0.2.dylib
│   ├── libcs50.a
│   └── libcs50.dylib -> libcs50-11.0.2.dylib
└── src
    └── cs50.c
```

To build a C program, you need `cs50.h` and either `libcs50-11.0.2.dylib` (for Dynamic Linking) or `libcs50.a` (for Static Linking).

## Option 1. Using Flags to Link Libraries

Use the following flags in your compile command:

- `-I` for include files.
- `-L` for library files.
- `-l` for library name.

Build `test.c` as follows:

```sh
cc -o test test.c -I./libcs50/build/include -L./libcs50/build/lib -lcs50
```

For an enhanced version, see [Build Script](./build.sh).

## Option 2. Using Dynamic Linking

Place `libcs50-11.0.2.dylib` in your CS50 project directory. The contents of the project directory will look like:

```console
$ ls
cs50.h        test.c        libcs50-11.0.2.dylib
```

Build `test.c` as follows:

```sh
cc -o test test.c -lcs50
```

## Option 3. Using Static Linking

Place `libcs50.a` in your CS50 project directory. The contents of the project directory will be:

```console
$ ls
cs50.h        test.c        libcs50.a
```

Build `test.c` as follows:

```sh
cc -o test test.c libcs50.a
```

## Running The Program

After building, you can run the `test` binary file with:

```sh
./test
```

## Why?

1. A minimal setup will lower the barrier to C programming.
2. You don't want to mess up the system's `lib` directory with a library that will never be reused.
3. In macOS, there are some problems with `dyld` (Dynamic Link Editor). For example, if you have disabled SIP (System Integrity Protection), you might encounter issues when following the methods described in official guides.
